<p>
    I am excited to announce that the latest version of TerosHDL has been 
    completely rewritten from scratch. This means that every line of code has been redesigned and optimized for 
    better performance, stability, and functionality.

    The decision to rewrite the tool was made after careful consideration of user feedback and industry trends. 
    We wanted to ensure that TerosHDL remains a leading-edge tool in the rapidly evolving field of hardware design.
    
    The new version of TerosHDL offers improved user experience with a more intuitive interface.
    
    I believe that the rewrite has taken TerosHDL to the next level, and we are confident that our users 
    will appreciate the new features and improvements. We look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to 
    innovate and improve TerosHDL to meet the needs of hardware designers around the world.
